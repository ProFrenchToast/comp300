# COMP300: Inverse Reinforcement Learning from demonstrations

This repository contains the code used to conduct the experiments for my
final year project on inverse reinforcement learning.

Additionally it contains an GUI to let users perform there own experiments 
without the needing to know the technical details.

Finally some of the results have been included to show examples of how to run
and analyse an experiment.
